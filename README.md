## Introduction

Heey!ðŸ‘‹ 
This repository contains solutions to the programming contests held by HackerRank for a university course. The contests cover a variety of topics and are meant to challenge and improve students' problem-solving and coding skills. The solutions provided here are written in Java and cover the first 5 weeks of contests. I hope these solutions are helpful for anyone looking for reference or guidance on the contests.ðŸ¤—
